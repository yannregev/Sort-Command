Notes about our solution:

- The binarySearchTree class implements iterable. This way anyone who uses the class will know it has iterators. "iterator" method returns ascending iterator by default.

- We have implemented the iterator class ourselves for the binarySearchTree. We used the successor and predecessor functions to get the next item in the tree.
