/* The method inputContainsCorrectSet(Scanner input, Set set) should, while
   reading the input (the answer), check whether the input is correct.

   If the input is not correct this method should (1) give an error explaining
   what was wrong with the input, (2) skip the remaining characters of the input
   and (3) return false.

   If the input is correct this method should (1) assign to the parameter set
   the value of the set of identifiers on the input and (2) return true.

   N.B. Do not try to give too intelligent errors. This is not an exercise in
        artificial intelligence.
        For instance, if the input is "{abc def} gh" instead of "{abc def gh}",
        an (relatively easy) error like "no input allowed after '}' is fine. You
        don't have to write a program that seems to understand what you were 
        trying to do and would give an error like "by accident you put the '}'
        before the last identifier instead of after it. Please correct this."
